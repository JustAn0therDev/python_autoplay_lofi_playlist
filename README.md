# python_autoplay_lofi_playlist
A simple and small python project for playing a lofi playlist on repeat

## Notes 

The API integration is not cool as I thought it was. The whole idea of automating Spotify to play a playlist as soon as I bootup my PC needs to have a grant permission first, which is made by prompting the user for permission by clicking on a button.

Yes, I know it can be solved by using a webscraper to click on the button but that's something I didn't want to do, since the whole point of creating the application was to keep things simple and automatic. Feel free to use the project for any other stuff while following the same steps I did to call the Spotify API.

This was made using the Spotipy Library. It's really good and pretty simple, you can find the documentation for it [here](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.12.0/).
